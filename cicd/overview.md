# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline for the AI Financial Fraud Detection Solution is designed to ensure reliable, automated, and secure deployments. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and orchestrates multiple stages of testing, validation, and deployment.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Security Scan
- Runs Snyk security scanning
- Identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Generates security reports
- Fails the pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are found

### 2. Terraform Validation
- Initializes Terraform
- Validates configuration files
- Generates execution plan
- Checks for configuration errors
- Ensures infrastructure changes are safe

### 3. Data Quality Tests
- Executes data quality validation
- Generates data quality reports
- Validates data pipeline integrity
- Ensures data governance compliance

### 4. Dataiku Integration Tests
- Runs integration tests
- Generates test plots and visualizations
- Validates model performance
- Ensures system integration

### 5. Infrastructure Deployment
- Deploys infrastructure using Terraform
- Only runs on the main branch
- Applies infrastructure changes
- Updates infrastructure state

### 6. Application Deployment
- Deploys application using Ansible
- Only runs on the main branch
- Configures application settings
- Updates application components

### 7. Documentation Update
- Updates documentation
- Deploys to GitHub Pages
- Only runs after successful deployment
- Maintains documentation versioning

## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/main-pipeline.yml`. Key configuration aspects include:

```yaml
name: Main Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```

## Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for infrastructure deployment
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for infrastructure deployment
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk API token for security scanning
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub token for documentation deployment

## Pipeline Triggers

The pipeline is triggered on:
- Push to main branch
- Push to develop branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Pull requests to develop branch

## Pipeline Artifacts

The pipeline generates the following artifacts:
- Security scan reports
- Terraform plan outputs
- Data quality reports
- Test results and plots
- Deployment logs

## Monitoring and Notifications

The pipeline includes:
- Slack notifications for pipeline status
- Email notifications for critical failures
- GitHub status checks
- Deployment status updates

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Protection**
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date

2. **Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security scanning in pipeline
   - Secrets management
   - Access control

3. **Testing**
   - Automated testing at each stage
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

4. **Documentation**
   - Automated documentation updates
   - Version control for documentation
   - Deployment documentation
   - Change logs

## Troubleshooting

Common pipeline issues and solutions:

1. **Pipeline Failures**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check resource availability
   - Validate configuration files

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check AWS credentials
   - Verify infrastructure state
   - Check application logs
   - Validate deployment configuration

3. **Test Failures**
   - Review test logs
   - Check test environment
   - Verify test data
   - Update test cases
