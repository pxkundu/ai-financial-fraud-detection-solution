---

# AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection Solution

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI/ML solution for detecting financial fraud in real-time. Built with modern cloud technologies and best practices in machine learning, it showcases:

- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Scalable cloud architecture
- Automated model training and deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our solution is built on a robust, scalable architecture:

    B --> C[Spark Streaming]
    C --> D[ML Models]
    D --> E[Alert System]
    E --> F[Monitoring Dashboard]
```

### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - REST API for transaction submission
   - Kafka for event streaming
   - Data validation and preprocessing

2. **Processing Layer**
   - Spark Streaming for real-time processing
   - Feature engineering pipeline
   - Data quality monitoring

3. **ML Layer**
   - Real-time prediction models
   - Model versioning and A/B testing
   - Automated retraining pipeline

4. **Infrastructure**
   - AWS ECS for container orchestration
   - Terraform for infrastructure as code
   - Ansible for configuration management
