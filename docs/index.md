# AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection Solution

![Project Banner](assets/images/quality_metrics.png)

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI/ML solution for detecting financial fraud in real-time. Built with modern cloud technologies and best practices in machine learning, it showcases:

- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Advanced anomaly detection
- Scalable cloud architecture
- Automated model training and deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our solution is built on a robust, scalable architecture:
