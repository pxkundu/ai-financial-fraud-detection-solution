## Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) Solution Design with Dataiku

### How Dataiku Helps in IDP Solution Design

Dataiku provides a unified platform to design, build, and monitor Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solutions. Here's how Dataiku supports each stage of the IDP workflow:

1. **End-to-End Workflow Orchestration**
   - Visual flows for document ingestion, OCR, extraction, validation, and analytics.
   - Automation and scheduling for efficient, consistent processing.
2. **Integration with OCR and NLP Tools**
   - Connects to OCR engines (AWS Textract, Tesseract, etc.) and NLP libraries.
   - Supports API calls to external document processing services.
3. **Custom Preprocessing and Extraction**
   - Custom Python/R recipes for advanced text cleaning, entity extraction, and table parsing.
   - Reusable plugins for scalable, consistent logic.
4. **Data Quality and Validation**
   - Built-in and custom checks for data completeness, format, and accuracy.
   - Human-in-the-loop review steps for manual validation.
5. **Machine Learning for Classification and Extraction**
   - Train and deploy ML models for document classification and information extraction.
   - Use AutoML for rapid prototyping and model comparison.
6. **Scalability and Integration**
   - Deploy on cloud or on-prem, scale as document volume grows.
   - Integrate with databases, cloud storage, and business apps.
7. **Monitoring and Governance**
   - Dashboards for monitoring processing volumes, error rates, and model performance.
   - Audit trails for compliance and traceability.

**How to read this diagram:**
- Documents are ingested (PDFs, images, scans).
- OCR is performed (using AWS Textract, Tesseract, etc.).
- Text is cleaned and parsed.
- Information is extracted using NLP, regex, or ML models.
- Data is validated and quality-checked.
- Optionally, a human reviews/corrects the extracted data.
- Structured data is output to files, databases, or APIs.
- Data is used for downstream analytics and reporting.

All the core processing steps are orchestrated and automated within Dataiku.

### Core Value Dataiku Brings to IDP

- **Faster Prototyping:** Rapidly build and iterate on IDP workflows without heavy coding.
- **Collaboration:** Data scientists, business analysts, and IT can work together in one platform.
- **Transparency:** Visual flows and dashboards make it easy to understand and audit the process.
- **Flexibility:** Combine no-code, low-code, and full-code approaches as needed.
- **Scalability:** Easily move from prototype to production, handling large document volumes.

Dataiku accelerates time-to-value and ensures high quality and compliance for IDP solutions.

### Step-by-Step Example: Invoice Processing Workflow in Dataiku

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - PDF or scanned image invoices are uploaded to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
   - Dataiku detects and imports new files automatically.
2. **OCR Processing**
   - Dataiku calls an OCR service (e.g., AWS Textract, Tesseract) to extract text and tables from invoices.
3. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Clean and parse extracted text: remove noise, normalize formats, split multi-page invoices.
4. **Information Extraction**
   - Use NLP, regex, or ML models to extract key fields: invoice number, date, vendor, line items, totals, etc.
5. **Data Validation & Quality Checks**
   - Validate required fields, check formats, flag duplicates or outliers using Dataiku plugins or custom checks.
6. **Human-in-the-Loop Review (Optional)**
   - Route flagged or low-confidence invoices to a Dataiku webapp or review workflow for manual correction.
7. **Structured Data Output**
   - Write validated data to a database, CSV, or push to an ERP/accounting system via API.
8. **Downstream Analytics & Reporting**
   - Use Dataiku dashboards or export data for spend analysis, vendor performance, compliance, and audit reporting.
