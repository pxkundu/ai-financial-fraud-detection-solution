- Real-time transaction analysis
- Historical pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Risk scoring system
- Model retraining pipeline

### 2. Infrastructure
- Scalable AWS infrastructure
- Containerized microservices
- High-availability architecture
- Automated scaling
- Disaster recovery

### 3. Data Processing
- Real-time data ingestion
- Data quality monitoring
- Data governance
- Data lineage tracking
- Compliance reporting

### 4. Security
- End-to-end encryption
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Security monitoring
- Compliance controls
