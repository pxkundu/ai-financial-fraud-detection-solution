  - Behavioral features (transaction frequency, velocity)
  - Risk scores (merchant, customer, location)
- **Model Training Plugin**: Implements multiple ML models
  - XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
  - LightGBM for fast training
  - Random Forest for interpretability
  - Gradient Boosting for ensemble learning
- **Model Monitoring Plugin**: Tracks model performance and data drift
  - Statistical drift detection
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Feature importance monitoring
  - Automated retraining triggers

#### Dataiku Flows
- **Data Processing Flow**: Handles data ingestion and preprocessing
